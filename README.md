# Structural Analysis
This module performs structural analysis of linear time invariant system tests such as:

  1. Structural controllability test.
  2. Structural observability test.
  3. Minimum driver node selection.
  4. Minimum sensor node selection
  4. Control profile of the network.
  5. Shows the input-output degree for each node.
